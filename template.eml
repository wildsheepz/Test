Dear [RMName],<br>
<br>
According to COO 33 Dormant Assets Policy, "A client relationship will be classified as Dormant when the client, their power of attorney and authorized signers are un-contactable. A client will be considered unÂ­contactable in the event there is no client initiated transaction in the portfolio, and no client contact within the past twelve months and all attempts to subsequently contact client have failed."<br>
<br>
This email serves as a reminder that the following portfolios have been identified as un-contactable without client-initiated transactions and no contact report for the past 12 months. In accordance with the COO 33-1 Dormant Assets Policy, you are hereby granted till the 8th day of next month to confirm whether the client is contactable. (Refer to required actions as stipulated below).<br><br>
